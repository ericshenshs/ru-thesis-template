Rutgers University Ph.D. Thesis Template
===================================================

This repo is forked from `rucsgss/thesis` with some minor updates according to the [recent style guide](http://gsnb.rutgers.edu/academics/electronic-thesis-and-dissertation-style-guide):
1. use 1.5in for left margin and 1in for other margins by `geometry`.
2. fix some capital letters in title page. See [sample page](https://grad.rutgers.edu/sites/default/files/2021-07/sample_phd_title_page_0.pdf).
3. put the copyright page before the title page. See [sample page](https://grad.rutgers.edu/sites/default/files/2021-07/sample_copyright_page.pdf). 
4. Replace the redefinition of `@xfloat` by using the setspace package.
